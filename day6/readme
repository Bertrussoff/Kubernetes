topic : service in k8s


three concept covered in service

#load balancing(cloud provider (access our application outside the world))
#service discovery(labels and selectors)
#port expose (cluster ip and node port,access our application inside the vpc)


#step 1:

please refer the day 5 read me File  i have coverd deployment in k8s 

once you done the deployment you continue this service


#step 2 :

i have created a node_port folder inside the folder there is a file named service.yml

read that file i have added selectors 

where can i get that selectors  i got it from the deployment File

and you can see the 

spec:
  type: 

here you can mention the service type 


and 

 ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
      nodePort: 30080


here i mentioned the nodeport type this is the port  i can i access the applictaion inside the vpc 
this spec type is spec:  type: NodePort   so by using this type we can access our application inside the vpc 




if you want to access your application from internet you go with  

spec:
  type: LoadBalancer

kubectl get svc  use this command to view the service external ip if you run your k8s in minikube in your local you will ket external ip as pending why?

because it is working only if you user ccp  which is cloud control provider


#step3
commands:

how to create a svc service 

kubectl apply -f service.yml

how to view the serice

kubectl get svc 

if you want to edit the service file after deployment you can you

kubectl edit svc serice_name
